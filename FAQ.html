<button class = "accordion" onClick = "s3()">Why <em>Descent</em>?Why not <em>Duke Nukem 3D?!</em>(Click to show text)</button>
<div class = "panel" id = "3">
<br/>
Duke Nukem 3d as only 9 weapons.<em>Descent</em> 1 has 10 weapons, and <em>Descent 2 </em>& <em>3</em> both have 20+ weapons.<em>Duke Nukem 3D</em> has drug use and other adult content, which can make it very kid unfriendly.<em>Descent</em> has some violence, but it's very unrealistic and pixel-y and it's stuff like spaceships shooting lasers.

<button class = "accordion" onClick = "s4()">Yeah, but it's nothing compared <em>Doom</em>.(Click to show text)</button>
<div class = "panel" id = "4">
<br/>
<em>Doom</em> has even less weapons, and still can be kid unfriendly sometimes.<br/>
